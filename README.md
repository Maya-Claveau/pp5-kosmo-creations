## **Why This**

The reason that I decided to create a jewelry store for my 5th and last project at CI, is that the designer of those beautiful jewelries – Eudokia Michaelidou holds a very special place in my heart. She is the most generous, kind, beautiful human being inside out. When I first arrived in Cyprus, as a foreign student, with limited knowledge of how things work outside of the college, and no knowledge of Greek, I was clueless and lost. Until I was lucky enough to have met Eudokia. We connected instantly, she said I was her lost child from China. She treated me as her own child...

**PAUSE** ... here I should give a bit more info about her situation at that time. She isn’t rich and have a big fat pile of cash laying around so she can just randomly take someone under her wing with no impact on her own life. At that time, she was a single mother with 4 children, no job and living on the government support. Struggling is an understatement to describe her situation, but still she took me in ...

**RESUME** ... she shared everything she had with no hesitance. Even treated me better than her own children sometimes. There are no words can describe how grateful I feel towards her, and she is the reason I feel very strong connection with Cyprus and see it as my second home country.

Fast forward today, she started this small business of making jewelries about a year ago, and I really wanted to utilize my newly gained skill to help her to have a digital presence. If Covid has taught me anything, it would be that digital business is the further, without it, you are failing before even start. So here we are, [Kosmo Creations](https://kosmo-creations.herokuapp.com/) with love from Cyprus!
